new electronics system based on distributed microcontrollers (MCU) and
multiple linked CAN networks was developed, in preparation for design
of legged robots with ten or more actuated joints. This allows
noise-prone analog sensor readings and high-speed motor control loops
to be pushed down to small MCU boards at the joint level, and results
in a far more compact wiring harness (just network and power cables),
reduced noise and ground problems, and increased modularity and
scalability. However, it also requires the development of a variety of
different MCU boards, each specialized to match the requirements of its
own local set of sensors and actuators. The major part of each board
would use circuitry common to all the boards, with variations in the
peripherals and interface circuits. Clearly, design modularity would be
key to designing and building all these boards within a reasonable cost
and time budget. Some commercial MCU board vendors use a stacking board
approach, as also used in Ranger's original electronics. An MCU module
is equipped with stacking connectors, and special-purpose daughter
boards with various interface circuits are plugged in as needed. This
was the approach used also for the "main brain" ARM9 board on Ranger, a
PhyCORE LPC3250 board from Phytec. However, for the "satellite" boards,
we decided that the stacking connectors wasted far too much board real
estate and design time. Instead, printed circuit modules were developed
at the board layout level, then copied and pasted to the final board in
various combinations. For example, most boards need an MCU module;
instead of laying out the MCU and all its support components for each
board, we just paste the pre-designed MCU layout into its spot on the
new board. The modules are positioned on the board with small gaps
between them, allowing interconnection and additional components as
needed.&nbsp;This documentation details the CAD software, procedures,
and standards for design of these electronics modules and boards.<br><br><h3>Creating a Schematic</h3><h4>1. Obtain necessary EAGLE CAD software</h4>The
lab uses CadSoft EAGLE for&nbsp;schematic capture and layout. EAGLE
Light is available as a free download from http://www.cadsoftusa.com.
While EAGLE Light is a good starting point for learning, it is limited
to two layers, while most board designs for the lab require four
layers. It lets you open and view the 4-layer board files, but for full
editing you will need the Standard, Educational (we have three copies),
or Hobbyist licenses.<br><h4>2. Begin a new project</h4>Open EAGLE and select New --&gt; Project. Begin with the schematic by choosing New --&gt; Schematic<br><h4>3. Adding components to the schematic</h4>For
this step, there are two possibilities: either the desired component
exists in an EAGLE library or you need to create a library entry for
that component. In the case of the latter, refer to the section
entitled "Creating a Library Part." If the desired component already
exists in an EAGLE library proceed with the following steps: Click on
the "Add" button on the left-hand side toolbar. This will open the
EAGLE library. Browse or search the library to find the component.
Highlight the component. If there are multiple packages for the device
consult the part information and choose the appropriate package.
Selecting the correct package is important for the layout step. Click
OK to exit the library screen and then place the component on the sheet
by clicking in the desired place(s) on the schematic. During this step,
you may add as many instances of this particular component as needed.
&nbsp;<br><h4>4. Modify the components</h4>Be sure to label each component with the correct name and value.<br><h4>5. Connect the components</h4>Connect
the components using nets. A net is a named set of connected component
pins. For example, the GND net might be the set of all component
leads/pins connected to ground. EAGLE names the nets It is helpful to
label the nets because it will help you while fixing wiring errors.<br>!!6. Run ERC<br>*Once
you have finished the schematic, run ERC to try to catch any errors
made in the design of your schematic. Do not continue onto the layout
phase if your schematic does not pass ERC.<br>!!7. Some Helpful Tips<br>*In
EAGLE, schematics can be multiple sheets. This is very helpful for a
complicated module or board with many components and nets.<br>*Nets do
not have to be physically connected. Labeling the nets identically
indicates to EAGLE that they should be considered connected<br>Picture 2(Below): Example of a Finished Schematic<br>{img src="img/wiki_up/FinishedSchematic.jpg" width=500 length=300 }<br>!__Creating an EAGLE Library Part__<br>*In
some cases, the part you need for your design does not exist in the
current EAGLE library. It is then necessary to create a library entry
in EAGLE for the part. The following steps, compiled by Jason Cortell,
outline the process of successfully creating a library part in EAGLE.<br>!!A. Getting Started<br>*Use
exactly one component per library file. This is not standard EAGLE
practice, but is necessary to maintain a version control of the boards.
<br>*From the EAGLE main menu, choose File --&gt; New --&gt; Library.
From there, you will create symbols and packages and link them together
to form an entry for a device. <br>!!B. Library Component Naming Convention<br>*It
is important to adhere to this convention because it makes the part
searchable later and it is very clear what part it is when you're
assembling the board. <br>#Use all capital letters. Separate sections of the file name with underscores, not spaces or hyphens<br>#The
first letter (or two) is the component type. E.g. C for capacitor, R
for resistor, L for inductor, J for connector or jack, D for diode, T
for transformer, Q for transistor, and U for ICs<br>#The next two
sections of the name should give some clue to the function and the
manufacturer name, if not generic. E.g., J_USB_HIROSE<br>#The next
section of the name should give the exact manufacturer's part number
for the component, if the part if not generic. E.g., SN74LVC1G07DRLR<br>#The
final section of the name should give the standard designation for the
package type, if available, or the full number assigned to it by the
manufacturer, if available. <br>!!C. Copying a Preexisting Library Device<br>*To
copy a preexisting library device, open the EAGLE control panel and
find the desired device in the list view. If you do not see the folder
you want click on the Options menu, then Directories..., and add the
path to the library path search string. Open or create the destination
library from the File menu in the Control Panel. You should see an
empty window. Drag the desired device from the list view to the open
destination library window. Save the destination library. <br>!!D. Copying a Preexisting Library Symbol or package<br>*Open
the source library and the destination symbol or package, then use the
dashed-square group selection tool to select the entire package or
symbol (make sure all the layers are displayed). Then use the cut
(scissors) tool to copy it to EAGLE's clipboard, open a new symbol or
package window in the destination library and use the paste to insert
it. Note, multiple open copies of EAGLE do not communicate with each
other so its not possible to copy-paste across copies.<br>!!E. Making a New Library Symbol<br>#
From the library main menu, choose Symbol and enter the name of the new
Symbol. Be sure to follow the naming convention specified in step B. <br>#Put
the origin of the symbol in the exact center of the part, unless you
have a very good reason not to. This makes placing the symbols and
moving them much easier later.<br>#Use the Symbols layer to draw your
schematic representation of your part. A simple rectangle is an easy
way to get started with an IC. <br>#Add pins. I usually put the input
pins on the left and the output pins on the right. Power supply pins
can be at the top and bottom. Choose appropriate directions for the pin
functions. E.g., input, output, power, NC, and passive. Avoid using
supply pins because they have the power to rename your signals and
nets, possibly causing trouble (use power pins for Vcc and GND, for
example).<br>#Add pin function names where needed. If the functions are
obvious from the symbol shape you do not need them. E.g., Diode cathode
and anode.<br>#Turn on or off pin names and numbers. (The numbers will
come from the package and the connections linking symbol to package
when you put them together to make a device).<br>#Add &gt;NAME and &gt;VALUE on layers Names and Values, using 0.07 proportional font at 8% ratio.<br>#For the symbol, use only a 0.1 inch grid; otherwise you will not be ble to connect wires to your part. <br>!!F. Making a New Library Package<br>#From the library, choose package and edit. Name the package appropriately. <br>#Put
the origin in the exact center of the part, you have a very good reason
not to. Machine part placement will not work otherwise. <br>#Use 8 mil
lines for silk screen layers (tNames, bNames, tPlace, bPlace). For
surface mount devices, put the lines on the top copper. <br>#Use layer
tNames for silkscreen text information. Use layer tPlace to show
placement location and orientation of parts. These should not overlap
the pads, solder mask, etc. <br>#Use layer tDoc for visual
representation of the part for layout an documentation purposes. This
should show the actual profile of the part and its leads, etc. Its okay
for this to overlap the pads because it will not be on the silkscreen.
This also helps to maintain clearance between parts during board
layout. <br>#Solder mask layer tStop should be 3 mils larger than the
copper in every direction. This is normally a setting in the DRC, but
if you end up making oddly shaped pads with polygons then you'll need
to know this. <br>#Add &gt;NAME and &gt;VALUe on layers tNames and tValues, respectively using 0.04 vector font at 20% ratio.<br>#Add
a tKeepout boundary if the part is larger than the land pattern in any
direction or if extra room is needed for soldering. Add tRestrict layer
lines to keep out polygon/power layers from under a part. <br>!!G. Making a New Library Device<br>#From the main library window, select device and name accordingly. <br>#Add symbol from the list of available symbols in the library. <br>#Add
package or packages from the list of available packages. In some cases
the exact same part is available in different packages and you may want
to create a package for each one. Instead of creating a new part for
every different package, multiple packages can be attached to one
symbol. <br>!__Creating a Layout__<br>!!1. Starting a Layout<br>To
switch from board to layout, go to File -&gt; Switch to Board and
create a new board. Please carefully read and follow the layout
specifications in the table below. In this lab, we only design
four-layer boards because it keeps manufacturing costs down. The table
at the end of this section, compiled by Jason Cortell, provides
specific criteria for board sizing, appropriate layer use, and running
the Design Rules Check (DRC). <br>!!2. Layout Tips and Tricks <br>#Designing
Board Area: Carefully following the specifications in the table, set
your board area. All components must be placed within this area. <br>#Planning
Out Board Area: Before laying down any traces, arrange components with
the marked off area. There will be yellow lines, called "airwires",
between components indicating necessary connections that must be made.
Try to arrange components such that the traces connecting components do
not need to be extremely complex. <br>#Using Supply Planes: Certain
layers are primarily for use as either ground or power supply planes.
Occasionally it will be necessary to create power polygons on other
layers of the board. There is a polygon drawing tool. <br>#Viewing
Layers: The display button allows you to choose which layers you want
to view. Also, when you are putting down traces, the top left tool bar
indicates which layer you are drawing traces on. There is a drop-down
menu to change layers. <br>#Using Vias: Vias allow you to connect
traces on different layers as well as connect to the ground and power
planes. General rule in the lab is that the few vias on the board the
better because vias increase the manufacturing cost of the board. <br>#Removing Traces; Use the "rip-up" tool to remove unwanted traces. <br>#Running
DRC Check: You must run DRC with the settings specified in the table.
This is crucial to ensure the board will be functioning. See section on
final error checks for all checks that must be run before the board is
completed. <br>!!3.

satellite boards are meant to be combinations of different modules in
order to complete a certain function. This section provides
step-by-step instructions for successfully copying a module to the
board. Compiled by Jason Cortell. <br>#Check that all your component
and net names are unique between the two boards. Each module/unit
should have a unique prefix number. For example, the LPC2194-CAN unit
has component numbers starting at 100 and net names with a 1_prefix.
Don't forget to check the ground and power symbols on the schematic and
even the page frames. They have names too. <br>#Make backup copies of you files. This process can completely ruin your layout and schematic if something goes wrong. <br>#Open the source board file. <br>#Turn on all layers, then use the selection tool to select the whole board. <br>#Use the cut (scissors) tool to copy the board layout to the paste buffer. <br>#From the same instance of EAGLE, open the destination board file. DO NOT open the schematic file. Turn on all layers. <br>#Use the paste (paintbrush) tool to copy in the layout. <br>#Save and close the board file. <br>#Open
the source schematic. Starting with the first schematic sheet, use the
selection tool and select the entire schematic, including the page
frame. <br>#Use the cut (scissors) tool to copy the schematic to the paste buffer. <br>#Open
the destination schematic. Ignore the warning the schematic and board
are not consistent. DO NOT do anything else - e.g. ERC, RATSNEST<br>#Create a new schematic sheet and paste in the module schematic. Save the file. <br>#Repeat the previous four steps for each additional schematic sheet in the source file. <br>#Now
run the ERC check. This will show you, hopefully, that the operation
was successful. It also reestablishes the forward-back annotation so
you can start editing the combined files.</body></html>
