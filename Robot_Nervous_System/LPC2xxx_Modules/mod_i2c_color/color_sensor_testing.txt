Flicker of fluorescent lights is apparently causing aliasing effects in the output of the sensor.

Questions: Can the sampling frequency be increased above the 120 Hz (say 240 Hz) of the lights?

Would the input bandwidth to the sensor be reduced if we increased the capacitor and integration values high enough?

What does that do to the ability to adjust to lighting conditions?

Results: The integration time affects both the sampling time and the sensitivity, as expected.

Sample times vs. integration values: (Code is running in main for maximum update rate)
1		3 mS	(All color sensor values 0)
1		2.5 mS	(At 200 KHz)
2		3 mS
4		3 mS
8		3 mS
16		3 mS	(at I2C clock rate of 150 KHz)
16		4 mS	(at I2C clock rate of 100 KHz)
16		2.5 mS	(at I2C clock rate of 200 KHz)
16		2 mS	(at I2C clock rate of 300 KHz)
16		400 KHz clock rate does not work
32		3.5 mS
64		3.5 mS	(Now seeing some non-zero values on white sensor)
100		3.5 mS 	(Values on all colors, for room light with lens)
200		4 mS
400		4.5 mS
500		5.5 mS
600		5.5 mS
700		5.5 mS
800		6.5 mS
900		6.5 mS	(at I2C clock rate of 150 KHz)
900		7.5 mS	(at I2C clock rate of 100 KHz)
1000		7 mS
1000		7 mS	(Changed capacitors from 15 to 1; no apparent change in sample time)
No apparent difference in waveforms when red capacitors = 1, green = 15.
2000		11 mS	(Back to capacitors = 15 for all colors)
3000		15 mS
4095		19 mS	(Maximum integration value)
4095		18 mS	(at I2C clock rate of 300 KHz)
