28 March 2011

This fsm was used to first record attempt on 27 March 2011.
Cornell Ranger walked 64.75 laps before falling.

The reason for fall was that the discrete hip controller over compensated and the robot took a big step eventually not making it to the top.

This controller might work fine if discrte gain on hip angle is made 1 from the present value of 2.
